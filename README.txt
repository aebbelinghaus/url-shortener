This is an app that shortens URLs. You paste in the URL that you want to shorten and press the big red button. This will present and copy the URL which you can then use.

Credit where it is due:

-Ryan Swapp's URL shortener package: https://github.com/ryanswapp/ryanswapp-url-shortener
-Iron Router: https://github.com/iron-meteor/iron-router
-Materialize: https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Materialize
-Alert: https://github.com/juliancwirko/meteor-s-alert

Note: sAlert pops up for having copied the short url however doesn't in this build. Had to code all of this again because of a Git committing issue and lost the original files. Didn't have enough time to program the copy-clipboard functionality.

Open and run Meteor in app directory.
